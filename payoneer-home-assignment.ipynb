    "You need to calculate for each login in logins table (please see below) what is the login level. For example, login id 222 is the first login so its level is 0, its child logins’ level is 1 etc. please write a SQL query that update the login level field.\n",

    "1. **Creating a Temporary CTE (Common Table Expression)**:\n",
    "   - I began by creating a temporary CTE called `RecursiveCTE`. CTEs are like temporary result sets that can be used within a query to store intermediate results during a recursive calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Anchor Member**:\n",
    "   - In the anchor member of the recursive query, I selected the root logins. These are logins that have no parent login. I set their initial level to 0, representing the top of the hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Member**:\n",
    "   - In the recursive member of the query, I performed a self-join on the `logins` table and the `RecursiveCTE`. This allowed me to traverse the hierarchical structure of logins.\n",
    "   - For each iteration, I incremented the login level by 1. This means that for each child login, the level increased by 1 compared to its parent, creating a hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Updating the Login Levels**:\n",
    "   - Finally, I used an `UPDATE` statement to update the `login_level` field in the original `logins` table based on the results obtained from the recursive CTE. This means that after running this query, the `login_level` field in the `logins` table will reflect the hierarchical level of each login.\n"

    "   - The process began with the creation of a table named `Fact_Money_In`. This table was designed to store comprehensive details about money-in transactions, including transaction ID, customer ID, transaction date, currency, amount, company ID, company category, update date, and an additional column for the equivalent amount in USD.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Loading and Transformation**:\n",
    "   - Next, data was loaded into this newly created table from two distinct sources: `Account_MoneyIn` and `Card_MoneyIn`. During this stage, several critical data quality checks and transformations occurred.\n",
    "   - Currencies were standardized to ensure consistency in the data. Any negative transaction amounts were corrected to be zero, maintaining data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Integration with Extended Details**:\n",
    "   - Subsequently, this integrated data in `Fact_Money_In` was combined with additional insights from the `MoneyIn_Extended_Details` table. Only records with valid `UpdateDate` values were retained, enhancing data reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Currency Conversion to USD**:\n",
    "   - Finally, a crucial financial conversion took place. The code calculated the USD equivalent amounts for each transaction. To achieve this, exchange rates from the `Currencies` table were utilized. These rates were applied to the original transaction amounts, ensuring that the data in the `Amount_USD` column accurately reflected the equivalent amounts in US dollars.\n",
